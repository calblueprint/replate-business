[Replate](http://re-plate.org) is a nonprofit organization that uses technology to eliminate food waste and hunger in the community. It enables people and businesses to donate surplus food to other nonprofits or people in need. Blueprint is working with Replate to build a web application that will allow businesses to sign up and request donation pickups directly.
